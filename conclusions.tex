\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In conclusion, convective boundary mixing (CBM) is a conglomeration of a few distinct dynamical processes.
These processes include mechanical overshoot, entrainment, and penetrative convection.
A thorough understanding and parameterization of each of these processes can reduce discrepancies between models and observations.

Modeling of convective boundaries has plagued stellar structure modelers for many years \todo{cite mesa}
Unfortunately, throughout the stellar structure literature, ``convective overshoot,'' ``convective penetration,'' and ``convective boundary mixing'' are often used interchangeably, which increases confusion regarding this tricky topic.
Coming to an agreement as a community about the terminology of convective boundary mixing and the processes that terminology refers to will help us pinpoint areas where models behave poorly and design experiments to improve those models.
