\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Observations tell us that we do not understand convective boundary mixing \citep[CBM,][]{pinsonneault_1997, claret_torres_2018, pedersen_etal_2021}.
In order to resolve this problem, we need to build a community understanding of CBM processes.
This note briefly describes three fluid dynamical processes: mechanical overshoot, entrainment, and penetrative convection.
Each of these processes occurs at convective boundaries in stars, and each should be separately parameterized and implemented in 1D stellar evolution software intstruments.
