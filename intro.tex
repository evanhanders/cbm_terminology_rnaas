\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Observations tell us we don't understand the mixing at convective boundaries.
\item In order to resolve this problem, we need to build a community understanding of CBM processes.
\item The literature of stellar astrophysics often uses the terms ``convective overshoot'' and ``convective penetration'' interchangeably.
However, these terms refer to separate and distinct fluid dynamical processes.
\item We will briefly describe three fluid dynamical processes which may be important at the boundaries of convective regions: convective overshoot, entrainment, and convective penetration.
