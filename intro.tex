\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Observations tell us that we do not understand convective boundary mixing (CBM).
\todo{CITE}
In order to resolve this problem, we need to build a community understanding of CBM processes.
In this note, we will briefly describe three fluid dynamical processes: convective overshoot, entrainment, and convective penetration.
Each of these processes likely occurs at convective boundaries in stars, and each should be separately parameterized and employed in 1D stellar evolution models.
